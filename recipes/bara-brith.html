            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Traditional Welsh tea bread, made with dried fruit soaked in tea.</p>
                <p>This is not the traditional recipe for bara brith, meaning <strong><em>speckled bread</em></strong> as the original 
                    recipe was based on a yeasted bread. However this version which is widely served, makes a beautifully 
                    moist cake as the dried fruit are soaked overnight in tea. 
                    It's best stored for a couple of days before eating, allowing the flavours to develop. </p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>400g Dried Mixed Fruit</li>
                    <li>300ml Hot Tea</li>
                    <li>100g Soft Dark Brown Sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp Mixed Spice</li>
                    <li>250g Self-raising Flour</li>
                    <li>1 Free-range Egg (beaten)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, place your dried mixed fruit, hot tea and sugar. Once the tea cools, 
                        cover and leave the fruit to soak up the tea and sugar over night.</li>
                    <li>The next day, pre-heat your oven to 180°c (160°c for fan assisted 
                        ovens or Gas Mark 4). Line a 2lb loaf tin with grease proof paper and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Sift the flour and mixed spice into the bowl of soaked mixed fruit. 
                        Add the [beaten] egg and mix everything together until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into your lined loaf tin, spreading to the corners. Bake in your pre-heated oven 
                        for about 1 hour, until dry on top and a skewer inserted comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>On a floured surface, pat the dough into a disk and gently roll out until 
                        it's about 1/4 to 1/3 of an 
                        inch thick. You can divide the dough in half and keep half of it in the 
                        fridge until you're ready for it if your rolling surface 
                        and frying pan/griddle are on the smaller side.</li>
                    <li>Once cool, remove from the tin but keep the greaseproof paper lining on. 
                        Bara Brith is best enjoyed after a couple of days kept in an air tight container, 
                        sliced with a spread of butter/margarine.</li>
